# Digibooky GUI

A very basic GUI written (also read: hacked a bit together) in Jquery.
It'll give you an idea of how a (very simple and basic) web-app will use your REST API / Back-end.

You're free to make any modifications or extensions to the GUI.

> More functionality will be added the moment your `controller` classes offer some endpoints the GUI can consume.
